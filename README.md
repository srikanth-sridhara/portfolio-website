# Portfolio website project.

Created by Srikanth Sridhara on 4th June 2017

This is a static portfolio website made using html and css. For styling and grid layout, [`bootstrap`](http://getbootstrap.com/) is used. To use github icon, [`fontawesome`](http://fontawesome.io/) is used. Two custom fonts are used for text: [`Simplifica`](http://freetypography.com/2014/03/24/free-font-simplifica/) and [`Raleway`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway).

## Important folders and files:

1. `portfolio.html`:
    This is the main html file that contains all the data.

2. `css\`:
    This folder contains all the stylesheets used in the project including bootstrap.

3. `fonts\`:
    This folder contains all the font files used in the project including fontawesome.

4. `img\`:

5. `js\`:

6. `css\style.css`:
    This is the main custom stylesheet used in the project.
